                      <p>A family from Europe, who moved to California, US to pursue an American Dream.<p>
                      <p>We were inspired by Bay Area residents who built their wealth in real estate. Heard about owners who purchased properties for $300k (just 15-20 years ago) which are now worth $2m? Well, yes... that's Bay Area reality.</p>
                      <p>Can we repeat this success? Can $2m property (regular 3-4 bed house in good school district) further double in the next 10-ish years? Well... that would mean insane taxes for future buyers!</p>
